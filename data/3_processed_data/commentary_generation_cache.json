Key performance drivers include substantial contributions from our technology holdings, particularly in semiconductor and AI sectors, with top positions in TSMC and NVIDIA. However, recent market volatility, particularly a sharp decline in AI infrastructure stocks, highlights the risks associated with concentrated exposure in high-growth sectors.\n\nLooking ahead, the investment landscape remains dynamic. While the technology sector continues to show promise, concerns regarding inflated valuations may lead to short-term corrections. The CIO of New York City's pension fund recently suggested that current market conditions reflect an \"investment supercycle,\" which could provide a favorable backdrop for long-term growth. Nonetheless, we remain vigilant regarding macroeconomic factors, including potential shifts in interest rates and geopolitical developments that could impact market stability. Our diversified sector and regional allocations aim to mitigate",
